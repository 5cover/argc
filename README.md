# argc

argc - print the number of arguments passed. That's it. ~~Seriously, why doesn't this already exist?~~

## Synopsis

`argc ARGUMENT...`

## Description

Print the number of argument passed to the program in base 10, followed by a newline.

The traditional `--help` and `--version` arguments aren't supported, in order to ensure seamless argument counting.
